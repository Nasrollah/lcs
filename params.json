The resulting output is a manifold with consistent triangulation orientation.\r\n\r\n![Max Strain LCS of ABC flow](https://raw.github.com/ameli/lcs/master/doc/figures/1.png \"Max Strain LCS of ABC flow\")\r\n<a name=\"figAAAexample\"></a>\r\n\r\n# Build Source\r\nSource code can be obtained from [github repository](https://github.com/ameli/lcs). Create a build directory and download the source code inside the build directory:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/ameli/lcs\r\n    $ cd lcs\r\n    $ mkdir build\r\n\r\nNow, build the code:\r\n\r\n    $ cd build\r\n    $ cmake ..\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ make install\r\n\r\nInstallation directory is in _install_ directory. For system wide installation, users may change _PROJECT_INSTALL_PATH_ in cmake. For UNIX systems a preferred system wide path is `/usr/local/bin`.\r\n\r\n# Program Usage\r\n\r\nThe programcan be used either in terminal or as a ParaView plugin. Here are examples to use it in terminal:\r\n\r\n    $ lcs /input-path/inputfile.vtk outputfile.vtk\r\n\r\nFor help, use `-h`, for get program information use `-i` and for see the license, use `-l` options.\r\n\r\n    $ lcs -h\r\n    $ lcs -i\r\n    $ lcs -l\r\n\r\nThe input file should be a `structured point` data. Also Cauchy-Green tensors should be included in `PointData` of the file as a tensor field. A sample of input data with few number line are as following:\r\n\r\n    # vtk DataFile Version 3.0\r\n    t = 0.000000000\r\n    ASCII\r\n    \r\n    DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS\r\n    DIMENSIONS 101 101 101\r\n    ORIGIN -3.141593 -3.141593 -3.141593\r\n    SPACING 0.062831853 0.062831853 0.062831853\r\n    \r\n    POINT_DATA 1030301\r\n    TENSORS CG double\r\n    1841.529748 -571.912532 -688.962477\r\n    -571.912532 178.498989 212.501996\r\n    -688.962477 212.501996 260.187902\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n# ParaView Plugin Usage\r\n\r\nFor using the program as a plugin, should select the `BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN` while configuring in `ccmake`. After compiling the code, the two shared libraries `libDeformationPlugin.so` and `linIdentifyStructuresPlugin.so` will be created in the `bin` folder. Depending on the operating system, the extension of shared libraries are different. In Linux, the expedition is `.so`, while in Mac and Windows are `.dll` and `.dylib` respectively.\r\n\r\nFigures [2](#PV1),[3](#PV2) and [4](#PV3) illustrates how to load the plugin and apply it to make a pipeline in ParaView. loading the plugin in ParaView. Users may find the filter in __Filter__ menu under __Extensions__.\r\n\r\n![Manage Plugins](https://raw.github.com/ameli/lcs/master/doc/figures/PV-1.png \"Manage Plugins\")\r\n<a name=\"PV1\"></a>\r\n\r\n![Load Plugins](https://raw.github.com/ameli/lcs/master/doc/figures/PV-2.png \"Load Plugins\")\r\n<a name=\"PV2\"></a>\r\n\r\n![Apply Plugins](https://raw.github.com/ameli/lcs/master/doc/figures/PV-3.png \"Apply Plugins\")\r\n<a name=\"PV3\"></a>\r\n\r\n# Options\r\nUsers can choose which type of deformation be used for extracting LCS.
